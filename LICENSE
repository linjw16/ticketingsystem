	I don't care about the license. 

	Public this project because I got an unexpected performance score of 100, seems to be the first in the class. But actually, it is not a nice project in terms of spatial complexity, you will see if u read the code or the doc. 

	Some classmate want me to share this work at that time last year. But I didn't see the message in WeChat group, neither I prepared the document. And it might be hard to read even with a doc now. So if you care, sent me an email and I will reply within a mouth :)
